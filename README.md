# Authentication-Registration-and-Login-in-MERN-stack


This repository contains an implementation of user authentication, registration, and login functionality using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The provided code allows developers to build robust user authentication systems for web applications developed with the MERN stack.

# Features

Registration: Users can register for a new account by providing their details such as name, email, and password.
Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their email and password.
Authentication: Secure authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure user sessions are authenticated and secure.
Password Encryption: User passwords are encrypted before storing them in the database to enhance security.
Validation: Input data is validated on both the client and server sides to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities.
Customizable: The code can be easily customized and integrated into existing MERN stack projects.

# Technologies Used
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information securely.
Express.js: Web application framework for building robust and scalable server-side applications.
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces and client-side applications.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
